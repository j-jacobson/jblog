# jblog
Program that allows easy manipulation and implementation of blog templates.

## Idea
Wanted a way to make it easy to type up a text document, hit a button, and have it be
uploaded to a blog correctly formatted.

## Implementation
Folders: Publish, Live, Settings
In 'Templates', the template and certain links that will help the tool.
In 'Live', the current source code of the website.
In 'Publish', where completed drafts are sent to be published. This is where the script
should live as well, so that the user can verify the correct files are due to be published.
